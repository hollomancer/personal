Hi, Iâ€™m Conrad.

I have worked for a decade to help people build awesome products. I work hard to be a positive driving force for any team, by bringing a creative, collaborative, and decisive mindset to the table. I enjoy fast-paced settings and thrive in rapidly changing environments.

Right now, I am focusing on supporting early stage startups - making awesome products, helping founders, and helping founders make awesome products. I currently work as a Program Director at Techstars, helping build a new program for one of the most impactful and founder-friendly startup accelerators and early stage investors in the world.

I believe that good character is good business, that giving is essential to success, and I take great joy in helping people become successful. I do a lot of advocacy work on STEM education in underrepresented communities. My main focus is as co-founder and member of the Board Directors of the national nonprofit Operation Code, which helps transitioning servicemembers, veterans, and military spouses enter software development through open source technology. I also volunteer at the local public library, teaching free classes on software development.

Managing and leading high-performance teams, ranging from product development to military operations, has been a tremendously rewarding experience. It's taught me that innovation originates from inspiring leadership, and that inspiring leadership originates from service to others. This takes integrity, authenticity, and just a little bit of audacity, too.

In my spare time, I read a lot of science fiction, and listen to electronic music, synthwave, and shoegaze. I am passionate about getting involved in adventures at the intersection of entrepreneurship and social impact, and trying out new delicious foods along the way.
